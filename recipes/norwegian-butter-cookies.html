    <h1>Norwegian Butter Cookies</h1>

    <p>These Norwegian Butter Cookies, or Serinakaker, are perhaps the Perfect Cookie. They’re super buttery, as the title suggests, and are similar to shortbread without being too crumbly. They are delicate and melt-in-your-mouth with subtle almond and vanilla flavors, and are so pretty sprinkled with sliced and chopped almond pieces.</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups salted butter softened (3 sticks)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>3 eggs divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup almonds sliced or finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and line one or two baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a large bowl, mix together softened butter (1.5 cups), baking powder (1/2 teaspoon), kosher salt (1/2 teaspoon), and flour (4 cups) with an electric hand mixer until well blended and the texture resembles coarse sand.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the sugar (1.5 cups) and mix until well combined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the vanilla extract (2 teaspoons) and almond extract (1/2 teaspoon) and two of the eggs, then mix until well combined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Using a small cookie scoop, measure out equal portions of the dough and roll into balls. Place on baking sheet and, using your thumb, press on the center of each ball to create a small indentation (if you find that the dough is too sticky, keep a small bowl of water next to you to dip your thumb into every so often).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Beat remaining egg in a small bowl and brush the tops and sides of each indented cookie with the egg. Sprinkle with the almonds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake for 16 minutes, or until cookies are only JUST beginning to brown.</p>
        </li>

    </ol>
